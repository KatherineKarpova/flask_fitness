## **Introduction**  
This web application serves as a personal workout tracker, leveraging modern web technologies to create an intuitive and effective tool for logging and analyzing workout data. Although primarily developed for personal use, the applicationâ€™s functionality and design allow others to utilize it as well. The aesthetic approach is deliberately minimalistic, emphasizing functionality and relevance to individual fitness goals.  

---

## **Authentication System**  
To enhance usability and security, the application includes a registration and login system. User registration requires an email and password, ensuring a streamlined process. Emails serve as unique identifiers and allow for password recovery if needed. The `validate_email` function from the `email_validator` library ensures email validity during registration. Both email addresses and passwords are securely hashed before being stored in the `users` table.  

---

## **Database Design**  
The database, named `fitness.db`, is structured to efficiently store workout data and related entities. Additional SQL commands, beyond those implemented in `app.py`, are housed in a separate `fitness.sql` file.  

### Database Tables  
- **Users Table**: Links user accounts to workout logs.  
- **Exercises Table**: Stores exercise names and their IDs, along with information about the muscles they target.  
- **Muscles Table**: Defines muscle names and IDs, forming a many-to-one relationship with exercises.  
- **Muscles_Worked Table**: Captures relationships between exercises and the muscles they engage, including roles as prime movers or synergists.  
- **Logs Table**: Records workout entries, storing the exercise ID, user ID, date, weight (in pounds), and repetitions.  

This schema ensures a scalable and normalized database structure capable of tracking complex relationships and facilitating analytics.  

---

## **Exercise Data Import**  
The application includes an `exercises.csv` file containing exercise metadata such as type, movement pattern, and targeted muscles. To populate the database, a separate Python script, `import_csv.py`, processes the CSV file.  

### Features  
- Command-line argument validation ensures the input file is a valid CSV.  
- Duplicate prevention using a reusable boolean function that checks table and column combinations for existing entries.  
- Automatic insertion of new data into the database.  

This design allows seamless updates to the exercise database by simply extending the CSV file and re-executing the script.

## **Integration of SQLAlchemy**  
Initially, SQLite3 was used for database interactions. However, to resolve issues with multi-threading, SQLAlchemy was integrated mid-development.  

### Key Features  
- SQLAlchemy is used for database operations in routes requiring data retrieval for the frontend.  
- Models were created for all database tables to future-proof the application, enabling potential expansion without altering the schema.  

---

## **Routine Management**  
The application allows users to create and edit workout routines, supported by additional tables:  

### Routine Tables  
- **Routines Table**: Stores routine names, IDs, and associated user IDs.  
- **Routine_Exercises Table**: Tracks exercises within each routine and the corresponding number of sets.  

### Features  
- **Create Routine**: Users input routine details via an HTML form, which are stored in the database through the `create_routine` route.  
- **Edit Routine**: Users select a routine to edit, with the current configuration prefilled in a form. Submissions update the database accordingly.  

Data for routines is fetched using JSON routes (`routine_names` and `full_routine`) to dynamically populate forms on the frontend.  

---

## **Workout Logging**  
The core functionality of the application is logging workouts.  

### Features  
- **Date Selection**: Users select a date via dropdown menus, defaulting to the current date with adjustments for varying month lengths and leap years.  
- **Routine Selection**: A dropdown menu populated from the database allows users to select a routine.  
- **Dynamic Input Forms**: Forms auto-generate input fields for each exercise in the routine, with fields for weight and repetitions per set.  

### Additional Functionality  
- Autocomplete suggestions for adding new exercises.  
- Dynamic addition of extra sets or exercises.  
- Validation to skip exercises not in the database or assign default values (e.g., weight defaults to 0 for bodyweight exercises).  

Workout data is submitted as lists, zipped together, and inserted into the database, ensuring accurate and structured logging.  

---

## **Statistics and Analysis**  
The application provides statistical insights by analyzing workout logs to identify trends in strength and training volume.  

### Implementation  
- Uses the Pandas library to process workout data into a DataFrame.  
- Visualizes data as images embedded directly into the webpage, simplifying frontend complexity.  

This approach ensures detailed, customizable analytics while maintaining a seamless user experience.

This application combines a streamlined user experience with robust backend functionality, serving as a comprehensive tool for tracking and improving fitness performance. Future iterations may include enhanced visualizations, expanded exercise libraries, and real-time analytics.
